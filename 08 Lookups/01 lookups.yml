# Lookups - 1
# Introduction: We have moved the credentials for hosts out of the inventory file 
# and moved into a separate csv file called credentials.csv. 

# Check it out!  In the given playbook, the password for the host web_server is
# hard-coded into a variable ansible_ssh_pass.

# Task:  Replace the Ansible Password field to use "lookup" plugin to lookup a "csvfile", 
# the file is "credentials.csv" and the value to lookup is "web_server".
