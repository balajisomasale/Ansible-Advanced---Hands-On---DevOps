## Error Handling - 2

# Introduction: We have added a new task at the end to send a notification email, 
# once all tasks are complete.

# However, the SMTP server is not very stable and these emails are not critical. 
# We would like Ansible to ignore even if the email task fails 

# Task: Set the ignore_errors option on the mail task to "yes" to ignore errors.
